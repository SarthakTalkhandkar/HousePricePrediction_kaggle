🏡 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict house prices using advanced Machine Learning techniques based on the Kaggle House Price Prediction Dataset. It involves complete data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment-ready prediction pipeline.

🎯 Objective

To build a regression model that accurately predicts house prices based on features such as area, number of rooms, location, quality, year built, and more.

📂 Project Workflow
🔹 1. Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values

Outlier detection and treatment

Log transformation to reduce skewness

Feature scaling (StandardScaler / MinMaxScaler)

Encoding categorical features (Label Encoding / One-Hot Encoding)

🔹 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Distribution of target variable (SalePrice)

Correlation heatmap

Feature importance analysis

Relationship plots between features and sale price

🔹 3. Feature Engineering

Creation of new features (TotalSF, Age, QualityScore)

Dimensionality reduction using PCA (optional)

Removing multicollinearity

🔹 4. Models Implemented

Linear Regression

Lasso & Ridge Regression

Random Forest Regressor

Gradient Boosting Regressor

XGBoost / LightGBM (if implemented)

Stacking and Ensemble models (optional)

🔹 5. Model Evaluation

R² Score

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

Cross-validation performance
